# LatvianRomani
Latvian Romani (Lotfitka) texts, lexicon and a range of tools for the development of the corpus


## Leimanis
Texts from the collection by Jānis Leimanis in the possession of the Latvian Folklore Archive (http://garamantas.lv/lv/collection/886320/Jana-Leimana-ciganu-folkloras-vakums)
Only the bilingual Latvian Romani/Latvian texts are currently considered. As the collection is to a large extent non-deciphered yet, this is a work in progress. However, the progress has become accelerated thanks to the Transkribus (https://read.transkribus.eu/transkribus/) team who granted access for training HTR models. Currently, a couple of models have been trained on about 5500 lines (~29000 words), the best one with the CER of 3.95% on the validation set. Now the new ground truth data is added by manually correcting automatically deciphered pages, and new models will soon be trained on the more extensive training data.

## Gospel of John (1933)
The Gospel was translated by Jānis Leimanis.

## Lists of lemmas
Lists of lemmas are provided in the UniParser format (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C12-2009.pdf), though currently fields with meanings need to be fixed. The wordlists have been converted from the XML file of the Latvian Romani dictionary from the ROMLEX collection (http://romani.uni-graz.at/romlex/) and provided by Jakob Wiedner from the University of Graz. The source of this lexical wordlist is the following Latvian Romani dictionary: Mānušs, Leksa, Neilands, Jānis & Rudevičs, Kārlis. 1997. Čigānu-Latviešu-Angļu un Latviešu-Čigānu Vārdnica. Riga: Zvaigzne ABC.

## Modern texts
These are the translations of Romani fairytales from Latvian, namely from the book "Laimes puķe" edited by Silvija Brice, who translated most of them from German and Russian, and added some texts from Jānis Leimanis archive (which requires comparison of the original manuscripts with the published versions, though of the Latvian text only; these are units 126, 169, 414, and 276).
The Latvian and Latvian Romani versions of most of these texts are published at the website http://www.pasakas.net/pasakas/citu_tautu_pasakas/ciganu-pasakas/, where the audiofiles in both languages are also provided, which gives a unique option to listen to Latvian Romani.

## RMS
Here, the information from the Latvian samples collected for the Romani Morphosyntax Database (https://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk//rms/) is going to be put.
